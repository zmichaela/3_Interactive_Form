# 3_Interactive_Form
 3rd TreeHouse Project

Used JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a made up conference called "FullStack Conf."

HTML and CSS files were supplied by Treehouse, I added JS to make the form more user-friendly.

Steps: 
Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.
